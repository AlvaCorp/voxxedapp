// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester utility that Flutter
// provides. For example, you can send tap and scroll gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to
// find child widgets in the widget tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties
// are correct.

// This file is meant to be run from the command line like this:
//
// flutter run on_device_test/conference_repository_test.dart
//
// This is necessary because the tests here require access to a working form of
// local storage, which is only available on a device or emulator.
