More importantly, a number of Spring projects provides cloud-vendor agnostic abstractions to developers, so that with a simple configuration switch, you are able to move your local application to run in an on-prem datacenter, or in the cloud with managed services.\r\n\r\nGoogle and Pivotal partnered to develop Spring Cloud adapters for Google Cloud Platform. With Spring Cloud GCP, you can quickly develop cloud native applications & harness the power of Google infrastructure. We'll introduce a number of projects we've been working on, including:\r\n\r\n* Spring Cloud Sleuth integration to send trace data to Stackdriver Trace\r\n* Spring Data for Cloud Spanner to quickly access globally distributed Spanner database with Object Relational Mapping.\r\n* Spring Integration channel adapters for Cloud Pub/Sub to use with Spring Messaging.\r\n* Spring Boot Starters for Google Cloud SQL to quickly connect to managed MySQL or PostgreSQL databases.\r\n* Spring Resource abstraction for Cloud Storage to inject shared file resources.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll show how to build",

This inefficiency becomes even more severe if that same logic needs to be implemented on a web application as well, leading to three different platforms to maintain and evolve. This setting not only leads to frustration, higher costs, and lower delivery times but also fragments your team into a heterogeneous and fragile set of specialists, one for each supported platform. At lastminute.com we were facing this exact painful scenario few months ago and we solved it applying a quite unique mix of React, React Native, and Typescript. This talk is is about the journey from being a team that writes the same code three times, to being one that writes it once and just deploy it three times. We will discuss the architectural challenges you need to solve, the pitfalls you must avoid, and the positive side effects your team will benefit from such a new setting.",

In more recent years, even as a consequence of the advent of multicore CPUs, Functional Programming and its principles started attracting more interest, becoming at least equally relevant in our industry. The biggest mistake made by programmers nowadays is considering OOP and FP as two mutually exclusive paradigms. This misconception is also the product of a misunderstanding about what OOP actually means and its founding principles. The biggest pros of OOP are polymorphism and encapsulation while FP strengths are immutabilty and its declarative style, but these features are orthogonal and there's no reason why they cannot coexist in the same program. The final purpose of this talk is twofold: debunking the misconceptions on OOP and showing that OOP and FP are actually complementary techniques that can happily coexist in the same codebase. It is the duty of experienced developers to fill their toolbox with both OOP and FP tools and to know from time to time how to choose and employ the tool that is the best fit for the problem at hand.",

Is it support, an open core approach, cloud services, or a combination of the three? And which ones are the features you can even commercialize without alienating your community?\r\n* Struggle: \"You received a 100 million dollars in venture capital and yet you have so many open issues?!\" Once money is involved the dynamics often change. How can you manage expectations and still build on a flourishing open source community?\r\n* Success: How do you balance open source and commercial success? How do you align engineering and sales decisions?\r\n\r\nThis talk takes the perspective of Elastic, the company behind the open source products Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash, which makes its money with support, the commercial X-Pack extensions, and cloud offerings.

So this means that most of the time laziness (of course not extremely) is useful for our productivity. On the other hand, laziness is extremely important when you work with a large amount of data and reduced space or power. In this talk we will try to cover all aspects of laziness in Kotlin: starting from lazy initialization of properties using delegates, lazy collections, sequences and, finally, laziness with coroutines. The main thing we would like to talk about is how to use this laziness and be productive with it. To see one more benefit of laziness in Kotlin weâll refactor a real application to use lazy calculations.\r\n",
