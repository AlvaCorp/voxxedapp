In turn, we will introduce the Reactive Programming technique for simplification our code and be turning everyday software development into the art. Since Java Non-Blocking API is nothing more than actions' execution and reacting to asynchronous responses, we will see how simple become development of complicated things with the usage of Reactive Programming with Project Reactor.",

Each pattern has its own demo, so you can easily try out the different approaches in your environment.",

We will finally discuss an important aspect, i.e. functions orchestration. For that We will use the Fn Flow API, a distributed Promise based API, to compose multiple functions into meaningful applications. Attend this session to see that Java is not antinomic to Serverless!",

The same data can be a graph in one context, but a document in another. Can't we just plug in the database we want and keep it up-to-date with our application data? With Kafka, Kafka Streams and Redhat's Debezium we can create an Event Driven Microservice architecture that can do just that, and the best part is that you can do this with existing legacy applications without too much trouble.",

Usually, there's somebody else, be it a product owner, marketing or salesperson, analyzing it and feeding developers a feature list needed for the next product release. There lies the gap between developers and users which leads to lots of guess-work. How can we remedy this and how can we accelerate this process? What if product micro-metrics could be directly integrated into the user-facing product components? And what if we could build these components to automatically adapt to users' behaviors based on micro-metrics and provide a personalized user experience? Today through the use of machine learning it is possible to optimize user interactions by measuring product micro-metrics and automatically adapting user-facing components to provide a personalized user experience.",

We’ll explain why Java has this dubious reputation, what’s being done to address the issues and what you have to do to reduce your exposure. You’ll learn about Java vulnerabilities in general: how they are reported, managed and fixed as well as learning about the specifics of attack vectors and just what a ‘vulnerability’ actually is. With the continuing increase in cybercrime it’s time you knew how to defend your code. With examples and code this talk will help you become more effective in reducing security issues in Java.",
