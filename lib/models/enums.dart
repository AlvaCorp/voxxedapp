/// the generated code. You can use any initializer starting _$ and the
/// generated code will match it. For example, you could initialize "yes" to
/// "_$yes", "_$y" or even "_$abc".

/// You need to write three pieces of boilerplate to hook up the generated
/// code: a constructor called `_`, a `values` method, and a `valueOf` method.
